# Train-company-web-page

I build this simple project for my web course. I had asked to create a webpage for users to book tickets.

I also created a docker image and an automated Azure process for testing and deployment (https://train-company.herokuapp.com/ was not deployed with the database) for the Software Engineer topic. You can open these files from the “docker-azure_pipeline” directory.

User roles: admin, user, guess.
